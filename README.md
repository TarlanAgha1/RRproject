rr_project In our project we will try to reproduce kaggle project. Below you can find the data set and details of project: https://www.kaggle.com/code/shirantha/bank-marketing-data-a-decision-tree-approach Our project will be written in R compared to original python code.

As part of the project we:
1. transforrmed project from python to R
2. ensured code is reproductible
  - added library verification and fixed versions of libraries
  - ensured data is loaded from UCI repo (original site where dataset was uploaded) instead of kaggle
  - added more code comments to enable more explainability
3.  created different models
4.  increased number of observations used for predicting with ml from 11k on kaggle to 45k
