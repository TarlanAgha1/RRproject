install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)

packages_version <- c(
  "readr" = "2.1.4", 
  "dplyr" = "1.1.2", 
  "ggplot2" = "3.4.2", 
)

check_and_install <- function(package, version) {
  if (!require(package, character.only = TRUE)) {
    package_version_install <- paste0(package, "@", version)
    remotes::install_version(package_version_install)
  }
}

mapply(check_and_install, names(packages_version), packages_version)
